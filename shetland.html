		<p id="title">Shetland Pony</p>

		<p id="text">The shetland pony is perfect for smaller 
riders starting to ride because of their size!
They are a small, but strong breed. They 
are also used as paddock companions, and
they are just too cute to resist.

They cannot be taller then 117cm (they 
are not measured in hands)</p>
