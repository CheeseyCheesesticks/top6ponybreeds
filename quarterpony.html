	<p id="title">Quarter Pony</p>

	<p id="text">The quarter pony is the perfect western 
	pony for everyone that is learning
	or competing in western. Because they
	are calm, they are mainly used for
	western lessons, but larger ponies might
	also be used for rodeo events.

	These ponies can be up to 14.2hh tall.</p>
